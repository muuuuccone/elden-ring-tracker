The northern one can be easily farmed by starting from the Castle Sol Rooftop site of grace and running south to the elevator.

The same can be achieved by shooting an arrow through the arrow slit in the grace platform (west side), although the knight doesn't always teleport when shooting him from this spot.  The southern one can be reached from the Church of the Eclipse site of grace by exiting through the church to the left, turning right outside, and heading up the ladder to the catwalks. After following the catwalk past the exile soldier and around the small tower, the Banished Knight can be found just past the ladder leading down. It is recommended that the player jump onto the lower roof next to the catwalk and tower, and bait the red-eyed Banished Knight into teleporting onto the small wooden catwalk extension of the roof; then the player can roll or jump to the walkway the Banished Knight was just standing on. The Banished Knight will slowly walk towards the player, then fall to its death onto the ground below, saving the player a good deal of trouble. Then the player walk down the walkway and make their way over to the loot, which will be in a corner, behind a tombstone.   Dropped from all other Banished Knights.

Go to the Third Church of Marika and face Southeast. Ride your horse until the cliff meets the water. The cliff side here should have a more red hue to it than the rest of the stone typically found in Limgrave. If you’re facing the wall due East you’ll notice a cragged vertical line where one part of the cliff face is protruding from another. Double jump on Torrent while following that and you should now be riding up the cliff face. Now turn your camera to face Northeast, you’ll notice what appears to be an arrowhead of grey stone forming a flat surface among the red-hued cliff. Jump there. Turn the camera South. While it doesn’t look feasible, sprint jump with torrent towards the protrusion across the before mentioned cragged vertical line. When you land, quickly double jump (facing East) to get on top of the ledge. You’ll notice above you several steps in the cliff face just slightly to the right- climb those. Then, jump due North onto the final platform. You will now be above the cliff and able to drop down. ",
