        "hint": "Where to find Great-Jar's Arsenal:   Reward for completing the The Great-Jar's challenge of defeating three NPC duelists in Dragonbarrow (northern Caelid).  You must kill all three NPC duelists in one life; dying will make it so you have to start from the first duelist again. You can access this area by coming up from Siofra Deep River Well in the underground.       This area can also be accessed by climbing the roots above the large crystal at the bottom of the valley. However, this is most likely unintentional.      Obtaining this talisman while playing online results in player's build being uploaded to the Elden Ring server to be used as randomized Knight of the Great Jar for other players.  When you talk to the Great-Jar, he will only respond with \"...\"  After talking to him, three red summon signs appear to summon three Knights of the Great-Jar.       In two of the four corners of the \"arena\", there are narrow rock outcroppings. Crouching or blocking in these spots will often cause the NPCs to fall off of the cliff as they attack. This is especially useful when sequence-breaking into this area with a low-level character.    Consider killing the closer of the two archer golems, as he will shoot arrows at you and disrupt your fights.    ",

If you start from the East Raya Lucaria Gate Site of Grace and kill the sitting Cuckoo Knight last, you'll have to either run back to the site of grace, kill all the surrounding mobs or use your Memory of Grace, since being in combat will prevent you from fast traveling.    Alternative route (click for image): Start in the Bellum Church and head east. While behind the ruin (Point 1), summon your spirit ash. Go around to the front, and immediately kill the caster standing on the ruin (just to make the fight less annoying). Kill the Cuckoo Knight  and two other mobs (Point 2); while fighting, a farther mob will sound a horn. This will summon a horseback Knight. While fighting the horseback Knight, another will come around during their standard patrol. After these three have been killed, head south-west and then east to go up the hill to Point 3. A solo Knight will be here. After killing, refill on HP/FP and jump down the ruins and follow the path to Point 4. Summon your ashes again to fight the group on the road, including a Knight. While fighting this group, you may attract the attention of the Knight on the north-west side of the road. If not, head up to kill them, then cross the road to kill the final one.

Credit to anonymous comment below for the following: I'll try and better explain what the writers meant by \u201cprecise jumps on the cliffs\u201d. Go to the Third Church of Marika and face Southeast. Ride your horse until the cliff meets the water. The cliff side here should have a more red hue to it than the rest of the stone typically found in Limgrave. If you\u2019re facing the wall due East you\u2019ll notice a cragged vertical line where one part of the cliff face is protruding from another. Double jump on Torrent while following that and you should now be riding up the cliff face. Now turn your camera to face Northeast, you\u2019ll notice what appears to be an arrowhead of grey stone forming a flat surface among the red-hued cliff. Jump there. Turn the camera South. While it doesn\u2019t look feasible, sprint jump with torrent towards the protrusion across the before mentioned cragged vertical line. When you land, quickly double jump (facing East) to get on top of the ledge. You\u2019ll notice above you several steps in the cliff face just slightly to the right- climb those. Then, jump due North onto the final platform. You will now be above the cliff and able to drop down. ",

When you reach at the location, although your map marks there is a tower, you will notice that there is nothing there! However, you will receive a map, called Mirage Riddle. You will have to interact with three Phantom crests.  The first one is next to that initial position, hard to miss.  The second one can be found by continuing to the west, near the rock wall. Enemies will spawn.  The final one, is near the Bower of Bounty site of grace. Starting at the Bower of Bounty site of grace, head directly south to the edge of a cliff. Here a small enemy will spawn. Once you see this enemy, head east along the cliffside. On the left side you will see a strange looking stone which you have to hit in order to reveal the phantom crest. The stone lies before the bridge and will likely have messages surrounding it. Once you found all three, head to where the tower was supposed to be, to actually find it this time. Climb all the way to the top to find this sorcery, along with Unseen Blade and x5 Slumbering Egg.Elden Ring Interactive",
